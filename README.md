# GCP IAM, Storage, and Compute Engine Hands-On Lab

## ðŸš€ Overview
In this project, I document my hands-on experience with **Google Cloud IAM**, **Cloud Storage**, and **Compute Engine** access control, focusing on setting up users, roles, and permissions to maintain secure access.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Creating IAM Users
To start, I created two IAM users for testing roles and permissions in the Google Cloud Console:

- **User-1**: `student-00-2e30b4fa0498@qwiklabs.net`
- **User-2**: `student-00-591f96ac3a3b@qwiklabs.net`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Assigning IAM Roles
I assigned the following IAM roles to **User-2** to ensure proper permissions:
- **Viewer** (read-only access to project resources)
- **Storage Object Viewer** (read-only access to Cloud Storage)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Creating a Cloud Storage Bucket
Next, I created a **Cloud Storage Bucket** to experiment with object access control.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Uploading and Managing Objects
I uploaded a test file and renamed it within the storage bucket for practice.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Verifying Access with Cloud Shell
To verify access, I used the `gcloud storage ls` command to ensure **User-2** could list files in the storage bucket.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Creating a Service Account
I created a service account (`read-bucket-objects`) with the **Storage Object Viewer** role to manage permissions securely.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Assigning the Service Account to Compute Engine
To ensure secure access to compute resources, I assigned the service account to a **Compute Engine VM**.

## âœ… Conclusion
This hands-on lab provided valuable experience in configuring **IAM roles**, **Cloud Storage permissions**, and **Compute Engine access control**. Key takeaways:
- Configured **user roles** and **service accounts** following the **principle of least privilege**.
- Verified user access and permissions with the **gcloud CLI**.
- Gained knowledge on **restricting VM access** using a controlled service account.
- Enhanced understanding of **Google Cloud security best practices**.

I am now confident in managing access control for Google Cloud resources and implementing security best practices.
